### **Journal Entry**

A **journal entry** is just a record of a financial transaction. Every time your business buys or sells something, you make a journal entry to track it. Each entry shows:

- **What happened** (the transaction).
- **What accounts are affected** (like cash, expenses, or sales).
- **How much** the transaction is for (the amount of money involved).

Journal entries follow a basic rule:
- **Debits** (left side) show what’s increased (like an asset or expense).
- **Credits** (right side) show what’s decreased or what the business owes (like liabilities or revenue).

For every transaction, **debits** and **credits** must always be equal to keep the accounts balanced.

### **Example of a Simple Journal Entry:**

1. **Bought Office Supplies** worth $500 on credit (i.e., amount will be paid later).
2. **Paid Rent** of $1,000 in cash.
3. **Made Sales** of $2,000 for products sold, and customers paid in cash.
4. **Paid Salaries** to employees totaling $1,500.

Let’s break down the journal entries for each transaction.

### **IMPORTANT:**

- **Debits** and **credits** must always balance for each transaction.
- **Debits** increase assets (like cash) or expenses (like rent or salaries).
- **Credits** increase liabilities (like accounts payable) or revenue (like sales).
- The total amount of **debits** equals the total amount of **credits** in every journal entry.


---

### **Key Points to Remember**:
- Every transaction has at least **one debit** and **one credit**.
- The total amount of **debits** must always equal the total amount of **credits** to keep the books balanced.

### **What is a Ledger?**

A **ledger** is like a collection of notebooks where each account has its own page (or "T-account"). On each page, you track the debits and credits for that particular account. Each time you post a journal entry, you update the appropriate T-account in the ledger.

Here’s how it works:
- The **left side** of the T-account is for **debits** (increases to assets or expenses).
- The **right side** is for **credits** (increases to liabilities or revenue, or decreases to assets).

### **Let’s Continue with the Same Transactions:**

### **Key Takeaways:**

1. **Ledger** accounts are the "big picture" view of each account. You summarize all the journal entries for that account here.
2. Each ledger account has a **debit side** (left) and a **credit side** (right).
3. **Debits increase assets and expenses**, while **credits increase liabilities and revenues** (or decrease assets).
4. The **balance** shows the current total after adding debits and credits for that account.
   
So, after the journal entries are posted, you use the ledger to track the running totals of each account (like cash, expenses, and revenues). It's an important step to understand how each transaction affects the overall financial position of your business.

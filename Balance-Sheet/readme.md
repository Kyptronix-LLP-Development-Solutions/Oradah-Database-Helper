### Key Notes:
- The **Total Assets** must always equal the **Total Liabilities and Equity**, as per the accounting equation:
  \[
  \text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}
  \]
- The **Balance Sheet** provides a snapshot of the companyâ€™s financial position at a particular point in time, highlighting what the company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities), as well as the equity available to shareholders.

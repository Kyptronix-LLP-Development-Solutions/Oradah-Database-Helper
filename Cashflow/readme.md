### **Sources of Data and Calculations**

#### **Operating Activities:**
1. **Net Income**:  
   Derived from the Income Statement:  
   Net Income=(Revenue (4000, 4100, 4200)−Returns (4300))−(Direct Costs (5000, 5100, 5200, 5300, 5900))−(Expenses (6000–6410))  

2. **Adjustments for Non-Cash Items**:  
   - **Depreciation (6100)**: Added back because it’s a non-cash expense.  
   - **Amortization (6010)**: Same reason as above.  
   - **Bad Debt Expense (6020)**: Adjusted as it does not involve cash movement.  

3. **Changes in Working Capital**:  
   - **Accounts Receivable (1200)**: Increase = cash outflow; Decrease = cash inflow.  
   - **Inventory (1400)**: Increase = cash outflow; Decrease = cash inflow.  
   - **Accounts Payable (2000)**: Increase = cash inflow; Decrease = cash outflow.  
   - **Prepaid Expenses (1300)**: Increase = cash outflow; Decrease = cash inflow.  

#### **Investing Activities:**
1. **Purchases of Fixed Assets**:  
   - Equipment, machinery, or other fixed assets purchased are cash outflows (Accounts 1500–1570).  
2. **Proceeds from Asset Sales**:  
   - Gains or proceeds from selling fixed assets (Account 7100) are inflows.  

#### **Financing Activities:**
1. **Owner’s Capital Contribution**:  
   - Any cash injected by the owner (Account 3100).  
2. **Loan Transactions**:  
   - Loan repayments (2200, 2210) are outflows.  
3. **Drawings (3200)**:  
   - Cash withdrawn by the owner is a cash outflow.

  - Revenue from sales and services is recorded under accounts such as **Sale of Goods (4000)** and **Service Revenue (4100)**.
  - Direct costs and expenses like **Cost of Goods Sold (5000)**, **Wages and Salaries (6430)**, **Rent (6290)**, and **Utilities (6410)** are directly related to cash outflows in the operating activities.

- **Investing Activities**:
  - Purchases of assets like **Office Equipment (1500)** and **Other Investments (1720)** are cash outflows, while proceeds from sales, such as **Gain on Sale of Equipment (7100)**, result in cash inflows.

- **Financing Activities**:
  - **Owner’s Equity (3100)** represents inflows from the owner’s capital contribution.
  - **Loan Payable (2200)** and **Owner’s Draws (3200)** represent cash outflows related to financing activities.

### Explanation of Cash Method:

- In the **cash method**, we record cash transactions when the cash actually moves—whether inflow (cash received) or outflow (cash paid).
- **Non-cash transactions** (like depreciation, amortization, or accrued revenue/expenses) are excluded from this cash flow statement.
- Only the actual changes in cash due to operational, investing, and financing activities are captured.

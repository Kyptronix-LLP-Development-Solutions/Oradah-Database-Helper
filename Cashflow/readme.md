### **Sources of Data and Calculations**

#### **Operating Activities:**
1. **Net Income**:  
   Derived from the Income Statement:  
   \[
   \text{Net Income} = (\text{Revenue (4000, 4100, 4200)} - \text{Returns (4300)}) - (\text{Direct Costs (5000, 5100, 5200, 5300, 5900)}) - (\text{Expenses (6000–6410)})
   \]  

2. **Adjustments for Non-Cash Items**:  
   - **Depreciation (6100)**: Added back because it’s a non-cash expense.  
   - **Amortization (6010)**: Same reason as above.  
   - **Bad Debt Expense (6020)**: Adjusted as it does not involve cash movement.  

3. **Changes in Working Capital**:  
   - **Accounts Receivable (1200)**: Increase = cash outflow; Decrease = cash inflow.  
   - **Inventory (1400)**: Increase = cash outflow; Decrease = cash inflow.  
   - **Accounts Payable (2000)**: Increase = cash inflow; Decrease = cash outflow.  
   - **Prepaid Expenses (1300)**: Increase = cash outflow; Decrease = cash inflow.  

#### **Investing Activities:**
1. **Purchases of Fixed Assets**:  
   - Equipment, machinery, or other fixed assets purchased are cash outflows (Accounts 1500–1570).  
2. **Proceeds from Asset Sales**:  
   - Gains or proceeds from selling fixed assets (Account 7100) are inflows.  

#### **Financing Activities:**
1. **Owner’s Capital Contribution**:  
   - Any cash injected by the owner (Account 3100).  
2. **Loan Transactions**:  
   - Loan repayments (2200, 2210) are outflows.  
3. **Drawings (3200)**:  
   - Cash withdrawn by the owner is a cash outflow.

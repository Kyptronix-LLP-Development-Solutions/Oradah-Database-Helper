Here's a **sample equity statement** based on **cash accounting**, using dummy data to show how it would look in practice. In cash accounting, only cash transactions are recognized, so we will focus on cash receipts, cash payments, dividends, and changes in the equity balance based on those cash flows.

### Breakdown of Equity statemet Format:

1. **Opening Balance of Equity**: This is the equity at the start of the period. In this case, it is **$50,000**.

2. **Cash Transactions**:
   - **Cash Sales**: Represents cash collected from sales during the period. In this case, **$120,000** is received from customers.
   - **Cash Received from Loans**: If the company has taken a loan, the cash received is included here, which is **$30,000** in this example.

3. **Cash Payments**:
   - **Cash Expenses (Operational)**: Includes the cash spent on operations (e.g., salaries, rent, etc.). Here, it is **$45,000**.
   - **Cash Loan Repayment**: The repayment of the loan principal, which is **$20,000**.

4. **Net Cash Income**: This is the sum of cash sales and cash loans, minus cash expenses and loan repayments. So, in this case:
   - \( 120,000 + 30,000 - 45,000 - 20,000 = 85,000 \)

5. **Dividends Paid**: If dividends are paid in cash, this is subtracted from the equity. In this case, **$10,000** in dividends are paid out.

6. **Closing Balance of Equity**: The equity at the end of the period is calculated by adding the **net cash income** to the **opening balance** and subtracting any dividends. Here, the closing balance is:
   - \( 50,000 + 85,000 - 10,000 = 125,000 \)

### Key Points:
- Only **cash** transactions (both inflows and outflows) affect the equity statement in **cash accounting**.
- **Non-cash items** like depreciation or unrealized gains are excluded.
- Dividends are accounted for when actually paid, not when declared.

This equity statement format is simple and directly reflects cash flows, as per cash accounting principles.

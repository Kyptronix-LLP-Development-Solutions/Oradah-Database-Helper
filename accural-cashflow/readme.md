### **Key Differences between the Two:**

1. **Cash Basis:**
   - The cash flow statement is simple and focuses on actual cash receipts and payments.
   - It doesn't reflect non-cash accounting adjustments like depreciation or changes in accounts receivable/payable.

2. **Accrual Basis:**
   - Starts with net income and adjusts for non-cash items (depreciation) and changes in working capital (accounts receivable, payable).
   - Provides a more comprehensive view of cash generated or used by operations after considering the accrual adjustments.

The income statement focuses on income and expenses. It does not include assets, liabilities, or equity. Here’s a quick breakdown of where each category fits in financial statements:

- **Income Statement**: Shows revenues (income) and expenses. It calculates net income or loss for a specific period.

- **Balance Sheet**: Displays assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. It provides a snapshot of what the business owns and owes.

- **Cash Flow Statement**: Shows the cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities.

- **Statement of Changes in Equity**: Details the changes in equity over a period, including contributions, distributions, and retained earnings.

So, for the income statement, only the categories with the type "Income" and "Expense" are relevant.
